# Intro
### BubbleSort Algorithm
* This variation of bubblesort utilizes a sorted prefix and unsorted suffix. The first value of the suffix will compare with each value of the prefix until a swap occurs. When the prefix reaches right before the stuffix and the suffix is less than the last entry of prefix, then suffix entry is moved to the end of prefix by incrementing suffix pointer.
